Problem description:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with **1** and **2**, the first **10** terms will be:
**1**, **2**, **3**, **5**, **8**, **13**, **21**, **34**, **55**, **89**...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed **_N_**, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
